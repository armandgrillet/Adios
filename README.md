Adios is the first ad blocker for iOS devices. It offers all the features of an ad blocker for desktop browsers:

- More than 20 ad lists available, each of them blocking all the ads of websites from a specific country. 
- Adios removes all the social media buttons and block all the malicious scripts attempting to your privacy. 
- If you need to see the ads on a specific website, use the whitelist to do so.

tl;dr Adios is offering you the next Web. You don't want to be tracked, you don't want to see silly ads. 
You deserve a fast and readable Web that is not killing your data quota. You deserve Adios.
